# Create a Lending Marketplace dapp on Polygon with Truffle Suite.

## Introduction

A Lending Marketplace provides a secure, flexible, open-source foundation for a decentralized loan marketplace on the Polygon blockchain. It provides the pieces necessary to create a decentralized lending exchange, including the requisite lending assets, repayments, and collateral infrastructure, enabling third parties to build applications for lending.

## Prerequisites

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a browser-based blockchain wallet that can be used to store any kind of digital assets and cryptocurrency.

[Polygon](https://docs.polygon.technology/) is a blockchain that is EVM compatible.

## Requirement

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) enables the development of fast web servers in JavaScript by bringing event-driven programming to web servers.

[Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) is a development environment and testing framework for EVM-based blockchains.

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript library that is used to create single-page applications' user interfaces.

## Create a truffle project

Install Truffle:
```
npm i -g truffle
```

Clone this [Git Repository](https://github.com/devilla/cryptolend.eth) and read the [Deploying and Debugging Smart Contracts on Polygon](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/deploying-and-debugging-smart-contracts-on-polygon) tutorial to setup network config inside Truffle and learn the deployment on the Polygon network.

```
git clone https://github.com/Devilla/cryptolend.eth.git
```
Go to the repository:
```
cd cryptolend.eth
```

Install the required depencencies:
```
npm i
```
## Create a loan contract

Here we’ll build the loan creator – A smart contract for both the lender & the requester to place their offer’s on loan. A person might be willing to offer a loan or requesting for a loan.!

### Importing the dependencies

OpenZeppelin Contracts helps you minimize risk by using battle-tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains.

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

import "openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol";
import "openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/lifecycle/Pausable.sol";
import "openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "./libs/LoanMath.sol";
import "./External/PriceFeeder.sol";
import "./libs/String.sol";

```

## Compile and migrate

Open `truffle console` to run a local blockchain in your terminal at `http://127.0.0.1:9545/`:
```
truffle develop
```

This will and display `Account addresses` along with their `Private Keys` and `Mnemonic` required for deploying the smart contracts.

In the `truffle console` compile the smart contracts:

```
truffle(develop)> compile

Now, `migrate` the compiled smart contracts:

```
truffle(develop)> migrate
